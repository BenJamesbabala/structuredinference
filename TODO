1) check that synthetic + polyphonic has been merged
-compile check

-write a list of all the options that are used for different code bases
-create sh files to run all the polyphonic files with different options and run then for 1 epoch
-do the same for synthetic use create experiment to create the necessary sh files

Once you've verified that everything compiles -> set everything to run. 

TODO: This includes doing a ****sperate**** run with the *** fixed *** NADE
TODO: At the end of the training script, create a small snippet to estimate the lower bound at test time
TODO: remember that for some of the larger NADE models, due to memory requirements, we have to use smaller models
Keep this in mind when creating the sh scripts
This should take ~24 hours. 

Create a file that takes in all the files created and creates the tables that are necessary/used
ipynb/ -> make sure the ipython notebook creates the synthetic plots as in the paper

Aaaaand you're done
