1) check that a simple template can be run [Done]

q2) check that synthetic + polyphonic has been merged
-do the same for synthetic use create experiment to create the necessary sh files [Done]
q3) Create READMEs in each directory [Done]

q3) Reproducing all the results  

1) Synthetic experiments 
2) Polyphonic


Additional TODO
---------------
For the polyphonic experiments, look into
TODO: This includes doing a ****sperate**** run with the *** fixed *** NADE
TODO: At the end of the training script, create a small snippet to estimate the lower bound at test time w/ 1000 samples from the recognition distribution
TODO: remember that for some of the larger NADE models, due to memory requirements, we have to use smaller models
Keep this in mind when creating the sh scripts
This should take ~24 hours. 

Finish up the readme. you need to be able to write all the features of the model. 

Create a file that takes in all the files created and creates the tables that are necessary/used

ipynb/ -> make sure the ipython notebook creates the synthetic plots as in the paper

Aaaaand you're done
--------------------------------------

Paper for arxiv

Edits to paper -> talk about the use of prior add in acknowledgements 
Clean up grammer and make small edits to cealn up notation etc.
